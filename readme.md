Hierarchical Key-Values project
=========
### An experimental set of Grasshopper components to manage hieracchical key-value pairs.


Description
-----------

There are many workflows within Grasshoper that involve the use of key-value data structures. There are many plug-ins in Grasshoper that have created components to deal with key-value structures. Unformatuntely various plugins have made slightly different choices on how to represent this data. These small design difference make it difficult to have thes plugins to work together.

Also many comprehensive workflows need to transfer data between Excel, Rhino/GH, Revit, Flux, DaySim, gbXML, XML, JSON and other non-SQL databases.  How can we easily handle this data?
